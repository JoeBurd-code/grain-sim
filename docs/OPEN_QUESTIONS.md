# Open questions register

One row per gap the sim engine actually reads, generated as the build trips
over it — not a wishlist. Per issue #15's user stories: nothing here blocks
work; each gap is assumed with a recorded rationale, and this register
doubles as the message to the engineer if a **load-bearing** gap ever needs
raising. Plant-behaviour questions are logged here, never put to the
project owner as a decision.

Columns:
- **Machine** — the `lineData.js` machine id.
- **Gap** — what isn't known.
- **Assumption in use** — the value the engine runs with today, and where in
  the code it lives.
- **Expected from** — engineer follow-up, the ~600-page operational spec, or
  neither (a demo-only choice with no real-world answer to absorb).
- **Load bearing?** — no if the assumption is insensitive across its
  plausible range (outcome doesn't change), yes if it is. Only load-bearing
  gaps are worth raising with the engineer.

## Machine 1: source valve → metal remover → treater buffer bin (issue #18)

| Machine | Gap | Assumption in use | Expected from | Load bearing? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `treaterBufferBin` | LSH (level switch high) set point — the real trip point may sit below 100% of working volume, not at the physical cap | Reject only once fully full (100% of the 7.7 m³ working volume); no separate switch threshold yet — `src/sim/behaviors.js` `capacityAvailableAccumulator` | Operational spec | No — the demo's point is the fill/reject behaviour, not the exact percentage it trips at; issue #19 (the control interlock) is where the switch's own set point starts to matter |
| `treaterBufferBin` | LSL (level switch low) set point | Not read yet; nothing in issue #18 consumes it (it gates the downstream drum feeder's start, added in #20) | Operational spec | No, for this machine's scope |
| `upstreamStub` (in-sim stand-in for the real yellow-bin valve, which is itself out of sim scope) | Close time of the real yellow-bin valve once the buffer bin signals full | Instantaneous (0 s) — modelled as synchronous backpressure at `upstreamStub`, not a timed close (`src/sim/engine.js` reverse-pass capacity check) | Operational spec | No — issue #19 is where a nonzero close time would first change on-screen behaviour (the delayed-cascade demo hinges on interlock latency, not this valve's own close time) |
| `treaterBufferBin` | Demo starting fill level (55%) | Not a plant fact — chosen so the bin visibly has both headroom and stock at t=0; `lineData.js` `sim.initialLevelFraction`, `provenance: "assumed"` | Neither — demo-only choice, nothing to absorb from the spec | No |
